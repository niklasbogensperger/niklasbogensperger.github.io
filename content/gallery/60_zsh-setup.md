My modular zsh configuration, including both environment setup (aliases, path configuration, etc.) and custom functions.

Custom functions include, among others:
- a set of functions for easily encrypting/decrypting files with gnupg
- a set of functions for creating clean zip/tar archives on macOS (no macOS-specific hidden files, no extraneous parent folders)
- a function to interactively set the name of a picture file to any of the (sometimes differing) EXIF timestamps included within its metadata
