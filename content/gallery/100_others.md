#### Projects

I have several other projects, either still in the idea stage or already archived, some of which can be found on my GitHub page.\
Topics that have passed the idea stage (but may nonetheless not be public) include, among others:\
macOS homebrew formulas, logo and merch design, 3D printing of lithophanes (thin, translucent, 3d-printed plaques, which reveal the image when held against a light source), Emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium, and QoL improvements in the form of small scripts for my regular workflows.


#### Sports & Hobbies

I am an avid runner, but I enjoy regular strength training as well. In the winter, my sport of choice is alpine skiing, and in the warmer months I have started playing/learning tennis.
