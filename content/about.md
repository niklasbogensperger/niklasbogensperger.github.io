Hello and welcome to my spot on the internet! My name is Niklas.

Let's get the academics out of the way first - I am currently pursuing a Masters degree in Physics at ETH ZÃ¼rich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology). Prior to this current endeavor, I completed a Bachelors degree at ETH, also in Physics.

As I was transitioning to the Masters level, I found myself gravitating to more applied topics where a background in Physics can help solve important issues which we are all facing on this planet. Personally, I decided that environmental issues and the energy transition are at the top of my list. As a result have come to be very passionate about this field.

Beyond the academics, I enjoy translating my ideas into code through various projects, both by myself and in a collaborative setting. You'll find a selection of these endeavors (the publicly available ones) on my GitHub page - each of them representing some skills learned, insights gained, or fun had.

Feel free to explore the showcase below and if you want to get in contact with me, I'm only a message away via the form at the bottom!
